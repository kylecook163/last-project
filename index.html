            <p>
                I'm kyle and this is a website so you can get to know me a little bit better.
                Though these pages you will learn about my intests and previous jobs they are split up for ease of use.
                There is also a contact page to send me a message if you feel like doing so.
            </p>

            <P>while I have you here I figured I would give you some of the general information about myself.
                I'm 16, in grade 10, go to Shaftesbury Highschool, attend PTEC and next year I will do enrolled at MITT.
